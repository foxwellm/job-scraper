Today the company runs one of the world's largest networks that powers more than 10 trillion requests per month. Cloudflare protects and accelerates any Internet application online without adding hardware, installing software, or changing a line of code. Internet properties powered by Cloudflare have all web traffic routed through its intelligent global network, which gets smarter with every request. As a result, they see significant improvement in performance and a decrease in spam and other attacks. Cloudflare was recognized by the World Economic Forum as a Technology Pioneer and named to Entrepreneur Magazine's Top Company Cultures list.\n\nWe realize people do not fit into neat boxes. We are looking for curious and empathetic individuals who are committed to developing themselves and learning new skills, and we are ready to help you do that. We cannot complete our mission without building a diverse and inclusive team. We hire the best people based on an evaluation of their potential and support them throughout their time at Cloudflare. Come join us!\n\nAbout the department\n\nProduct Strategy is where new, bold, products are built and released within Cloudflare. Rather than being constrained by the structures which make Cloudflare a massively successful business, we are able to leverage them to deliver entirely new tools and products to our customers. Cloudflare's edge and network make it possible to solve problems at massive scale and efficiency which would be impossible for almost any other organization.\n\nAt any given moment, Product Strategy is engaged in a half dozen projects, each driven by a small technical team of just a handful of developers. These teams are empowered to drive the product and technical vision to build things which are, in the words of our CTO, 'audacious'. Unlike an R&D division, Product Strategy doesn't build theoretical or abstract tools, we brought six products to market in the first quarter of this year alone.\n\nWhat you'll do\n\nWe are looking for experienced front-end engineers to join our team. The ideal candidates will have experience working with large-scale applications and a track record of producing great output. You must care deeply not only about the quality of your and the team's code, but also the customer experience. We have growing front-end needs, so we're looking for highly motivated individuals that are excited to join a team and work with product and content owners, designers, and other software engineers to build and scale services at Cloudflare.\n\nWe believe that a great design is at the heart of any successful product and you will work closely with our design/UX team and must be comfortable seeking feedback from non-technical sources. We work iteratively and deploy often (sometimes several times per day). We are also strong believers in dog-fooding our own products. From cache configuration to Cloudflare Access to Cloudflare Workers, these are all tools in our frontend engineer's tool belt. \n\nTechnologies we use include Node, React, Redux, TypeScript, ES6, Webpack, Fela, Jest, Enzyme, Puppeteer, D3, and more.\n\nExamples of desirable skills, knowledge and experience\n\nNote: it is not required that you have all of these! Teams have varying needs, focuses, and use varying technologies.\nBA/BS in Computer Science or equivalent\nMinimum of 2+ years experience building web applications\nStrong knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript\nUnderstanding of responsive design and its implementation\nExperience building and shipping production React.js applications\nExtensive knowledge of the JavaScript ecosystem\nAbility to work in cross-functional teams\nGood analytical and debugging skills\nUnit/integration testing experience\nExperience working with and/or designing RESTful APIs\nWorking knowledge of internationalization, localization, and/or accessibility\nExpertise with TypeScript\nWhat Makes Cloudflare Special?\n\nWe're not just a highly ambitious, large-scale technology company. We're a highly ambitious, large-scale technology company with a soul. Fundamental to our mission to help build a better Internet is protecting the free and open Internet.\n\nProject Galileo: We equip politically and artistically important organizations and journalists with powerful tools to defend themselves against attacks that would otherwise censor their work, technology already used by Cloudflare's enterprise customers--at no cost.\n\nProject Athenian: We created Athenian Project to ensure that state and local governments have the highest level of protection and reliability for free, so that their constituents have access to election information and voter registration.\n\nPath Forward Partnership: Since 2016, we have partnered with Path Forward, a nonprofit organization, to create 16-week positions for mid-career professionals who want to get back to the workplace after taking time off to care for a child, parent, or loved one.\n\n1.1.1.1: We released 1.1.1.1 to help fix the foundation of the Internet by building a faster, more secure and privacy-centric public DNS resolver. This is available publicly for everyone to use - it is the first consumer-focused service Cloudflare has ever released. Here's the deal - we don't store client IP addresses never, ever. We will continue to abide by our privacy policy and ensure that no user data is sold to advertisers or used to target consumers.\n\nSound like something you'd like to be a part of? We'd love to hear from you!\n\nCloudflare is proud to be an equal opportunity employer.

As a public benefit corporation, we have a social mission written into our founding charter. The people who work at Nava have a fiduciary duty to our stated mission: to improve access, effectiveness, and simplicity of government services. We see this as an opportunity, but it is also important to highlight the challenges we face in advance.\n\n\nYou will be working within the government ecosystem, which means working dynamically, with other government contractors and civil servants. Working with people outside of your company means you'll likely encounter different working styles and cultural norms. At the same time, working as part of a larger team allows us to deliver on projects of larger scale and complexity.\n\n\nThe government also imposes a level of bureaucracy that is typically not present in a company of our size in the private sector. We operate in a regulated environment, where checks and compliance is built into the process of building software. This can make the path to production slower and some decisions, such as tools and processes, lie outside of our control. However, beyond writing code, finding and recommending ways to improve the way government software is built is one of the highest-leverage ways we help fulfill our mission. While our work is to build new systems with up-to-date technology, we have to do that within an existing ecosystem. Our work is building functional, resilient software for production. We don't build flashy prototypes that don't work for real people.\nWhat you'll do\nCollaborate with the product team, government stakeholders, and other contractors to build new systems and make improvements to existing systems.\nDesign and spec out major functionality and flows.\nDrive ideas from concept to production, from sketching and wireframing to implementation and launching to production.\nParticipate in planning and breaking down requirements into tasks.\nReview code and give feedback on technical specs.\nMake improvements by proposing new tools and practices.\nWhat we're looking for\nAt least two years of experience working in an agile, multidisciplinary team environment, preferably designing and building medium or large-scale web applications\nExperience mapping and driving systemic improvements within complex service environments\nUnderstanding of web and mobile user interface design best practices\nSignificant experience in JavaScript, CSS, and responsive design\nDemonstrated ability to design, build, and test semantic, accessible, Section 508 compliant web applications.\nUnderstanding of inclusive design methodologies\nSome experience with a modern JavaScript framework, such as React, Vue.js, Angular or Ember\nFamiliarity with a JavaScript testing framework such as Jest, Jasmine, or Mocha\nTenacity to dive into problems and iterate in working code\nEqual parts systems thinker and advocate for users\nHighly resourceful, reliable, and detail-oriented\nAbility to think strategically around trade-offs and short term vs. long term benefits\nAn adaptive, empathetic, collaborative and positive mindset\nExcellent written and verbal communication skills, technical and otherwise\nThings that are not important to us\nWhether or not you have a CS or engineering degree (or any degree).\nWhether or not you have GitHub contributions.
