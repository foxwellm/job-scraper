These aren’t easy goals to accomplish – but we’re not here for easy. We’re here for better. We are a company built on the foundation of challenging and disrupting the way things are done, and we’re looking for innovators who are as committed to shaping the future of cybersecurity as we are.\n\nYour Career\n\nIn this team, you will work on an exciting and new disruptive technology that is fundamentally changing the way people engage and think about Technical Support Services. Traditional Technical Support is performed by human engineers that read through vast amounts of log files to determine the cause and solution to a problem, but what if a machine were able to do that faster and more effectively than a human? If you are creative, passionate, curious, inquisitive, and love to innovate, you'll fit in with our team well.\n\nYour Impact\n\nLooking for a full stack engineer who can develop a highly visual, interactive, and intuitive web-based user interface, backend APIs, infrastructure, and intelligence that automates many Technical Support, Professional Services, and QA tasks\nExplore and suggest ideas for new features and functionality that make the application an industry-leading example for diagnostic and automation tools\nBe available to provide application support during business hours, and off-hours for business-critical situations when needed\n\n\nYour Experience\n\nProficiency in React, Angular, Node.JS, and Javascript\nKnowledge of Linux, HTTP, RESTFUL APIs, and JSON\nExperience working with Ansible, Python, and PHP a plus\nOpportunity for growth in the following areas, Databases, Caching, Amazon Web Services, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Predictive Analytics, and Big Data\nPrevious experience in a Technical Support, Professional Services, or QA role would be highly advantageous but not required\n\nThe Team\n\nTo stay ahead of the curve, it’s critical to know where the curve is, and how to anticipate the changes we’re facing. For the fastest growing cybersecurity company, the curve is the evolution of cyberattacks and the products and services that proactively address them. Our engineering team is at the core of our products – connected directly to the mission of preventing cyberattacks. They are constantly innovating – challenging the way we, and the industry, think about cybersecurity. These engineers aren’t shy about building products to solve problems no one has pursued before. They define the industry, instead of waiting for directions. We need individuals who feel comfortable in ambiguity, excited by the prospect of a challenge, and empowered by the unknown risks facing our everyday lives that are only enabled by a secure digital environment.\n\nOur engineering team is provided with an unrivaled chance to create the products and practices that will support our company growth over the next decade, defining the cybersecurity industry as we know it. If you see the potential of how incredible people products can transform a business, this is the team for you. If you don’t wait for directions, instead, identifying new features and opportunities we have to just get better, this is your new career.\n\nOur Commitment\n\nWe’re trailblazers that dream big, take risks, and challenge cybersecurity’s status quo. It’s simple: we can’t accomplish our mission without diverse teams innovating, together.
