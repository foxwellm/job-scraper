Top ten pharmaceutical companies and emerging biotech companies use the platform to conduct efficient, reproducible and rapid experimentation from anywhere in the world.\n\nOur Team\n\nThere are two separate web apps that our team owns. The first is secure.transcriptic.com, which is where end users manage their scientific workflow on Transcriptic. The other is a UI that is used to monitor and control our lab automation robots.\n\nThe \"Webapp\"\n\nThe customer facing app, secure.transcriptic.com, is responsible for letting end users manage their science on Transcriptic -- upload protocols, launch experiments, track experiments, manage inventory, view diagnostic data, etc. It is a React single page app on a Rails API. We use tech like Postgres, Rails, Elastic Search, json api, Docker, es6/TypeScript, React, and webpack. You can learn more about its functionality at developers.transcriptic.com. It is responsible for parsing, checking, and virtually executing Autoprotocol (autoprotocol.org) which is our open source language for describing scientific intent. You can kind of think of the web app as an IDE for scientists to do their work -- it is a one stop shop for launching real experiments to be executed and analyzed. A big part of our team's role is to think about how science can be done remotely, through code and data science, instead of by hand. Providing a rich interface to a robotic cloud lab is no easy task.\n\nThe \"TCLE Dashboard\"\n\nThe TCLE dashboard is a UI that the operators use to control our automated labs. The operator uses this interface to monitor the progress of the robotics and to know when they are needed to add and remove resources. Its primary feature is an interactive and real time graph of the schedule of tasks that is rendered on an HTML canvas. The stack for this app (for the web portion) is React, TypeScript, websockets, and a thin Scala server using Akka Http. This sits on top of \"TCLE\" -- the backend of our system which is managed by another group within software and is responsible for scheduling and executing the entire experiment.\n\nWe also have a couple of JS libraries that both of these apps depend on, which we host on our private npm registry (Gemfury). For example, https://amino.transcriptic.com/ is our design system and our React component library. This helps us have consistent UI across both apps.\n\nWe Want\n\nThe Web team is looking to add experienced engineers who want to build the future of scientific research. We joined this company to revolutionize science and we want to work with people who appreciate the mission. We are less concerned about your specific knowledge of languages/frameworks and our interview process is tailored to be agnostic to how you built web apps in the past. We have a broad technology stack with many moving pieces.

The company quickly grew from an exciting idea to a business that has materially shaped the beauty industry: we've activated an enormous group of underserved, untapped consumers, awakening their relationship with beauty by making the experience relevant, easy and fun. Our innovation isn't the simple concept of delivering a box of samples - it's understanding that although not everyone is passionate about beauty and grooming, everyone still deserves to have a great experience finding, trying and buying it.\n\nBirchbox operates in six countries, reaching more than 2.5 million active customers with a portfolio of 500 best-in-class prestige brand partners.

Top ten pharmaceutical companies and emerging biotech companies use the platform to conduct efficient, reproducible and rapid experimentation from anywhere in the world.\n\nOur Team\n\nThere are two separate web apps that our team owns. The first is secure.transcriptic.com, which is where end users manage their scientific workflow on Strateos. The other is a UI that is used to monitor and control our lab automation robots.\n\nThe \"Webapp\"\n\nThe customer facing app, secure.transcriptic.com, is responsible for letting end users manage their science on Strateos -- upload protocols, launch experiments, track experiments, manage inventory, view diagnostic data, etc. It is a React single page app on a Rails API. We use tech like Postgres, Rails, Elastic Search, json api, Docker, es6/TypeScript, React, and webpack. You can learn more about its functionality at developers.transcriptic.com. It is responsible for parsing, checking, and virtually executing Autoprotocol (autoprotocol.org) which is our open source language for describing scientific intent. You can kind of think of the web app as an IDE for scientists to do their work -- it is a one stop shop for launching real experiments to be executed and analyzed. A big part of our team's role is to think about how science can be done remotely, through code and data science, instead of by hand. Providing a rich interface to a robotic cloud lab is no easy task.\n\nThe \"TCLE Dashboard\"\n\nThe TCLE dashboard is a UI that the operators use to control our automated labs. The operator uses this interface to monitor the progress of the robotics and to know when they are needed to add and remove resources. Its primary feature is an interactive and real time graph of the schedule of tasks that is rendered on an HTML canvas. The stack for this app (for the web portion) is React, TypeScript, websockets, and a thin Scala server using Akka Http. This sits on top of \"TCLE\" -- the backend of our system which is managed by another group within software and is responsible for scheduling and executing the entire experiment.\n\nWe also have a couple of JS libraries that both of these apps depend on, which we host on our private npm registry (Gemfury). For example, https://amino.transcriptic.com/ is our design system and our React component library. This helps us have consistent UI across both apps.\n\nWe Want\n\nThe Web team is looking to add experienced engineers who want to build the future of scientific research. We joined this company to revolutionize science and we want to work with people who appreciate the mission. All members of the web team currently work on the frontend, but no one exclusively so.
